1.2: Use a Passive Asset Discovery Tool
=======================================

Utilize a passive discovery tool to identify devices connected to the organization’s network and automatically update the organization’s hardware asset inventory.

Inputs
------
#. The list of the organization's networks
#. The list of passive asset discovery tools in use by the organization. For each, include the location of the tool's configuration information and which networks it covers.
#. Approved configuration(s) for each passive asset discovery tool. Configurations should include the settings necessary for the tool to be able to update the organization's hardware asset inventory.

Operations
----------
#. For each passive asset discovery tool provided in Input 2, check the tool's configuration against the appropriate approved configuration from Input 3.
	#. Create a list of those tools that are properly configured (M1)
	#. Create a list of those tools that are improperly configured (M2) noting the deviations from proper configuration
#. For each of the organization's networks provided in Input 1, check Input 2 and M1 to ensure that at least one properly configured passive asset discovery tool covers that network.
	#. Create a list of the organization's networks that have coverage from at least one properly configured passive asset discovery tool (M3)
	#. Create a list of the organization's networks that do not have coverage from any properly configured passive asset discovery tools (M4)

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of properly configured passive asset discovery tools (compliant tool list)
* M2 = List of improperly configured passive asset discovery tools (non-compliant tool list)
* M3 = List of organization's networks with coverage from at least one properly configured passive asset discovery tool (compliant network list)
* M4 = List of organization's networks that do not have coverage from any properly configured passive asset discovery tool (non-compliant network list)
* M5 = Count of networks with coverage from at least one properly configured passive asset discovery tool (count of M3)
* M6 = Total count of the organization's networks (count of Input 1)

Metrics

Coverage
^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

	* - **Metric**
	  - | The ratio of the organization's networks with coverage from at least one properly configured passive asset discovery tool to the total number of networks
