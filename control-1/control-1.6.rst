1.6: Address Unauthorized Assets
================================
Ensure that unauthorized assets are either removed from the network, quarantined or the inventory is updated in a timely manner.

Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory

Inputs
-----------
#. A list of discovered assets not currently present in the asset inventory ("unauthorized" assets).
#. Endpoint Inventory: Current hardware inventory (sub-control 1.4)
#. An organizationally defined time frame for "timely" (recommend 24 hours or better)
#. (Optional) Measurement results would be more useful if the disposition of the items (removed, added to inventory, quarantined, etc.) was provided to be verified, but this is not absolutely necessary.

Operations
----------
If the optional disposition list is provided, the checks would be tailored to those dispositions.  For the following, assume no disposition list is available:

#. At the time frame specified by Input 3, for each unauthorized asset (Input 1), check to see if the asset is present in the updated asset inventory (Input 2), keeping track of unauthorized items
#. For those Input 1 items that are not in Input 2, scan the network to determine if the item is still reachable on the network.

Assumptions
^^^^^^^^^^^
If the item is not reachable, it may be reasonable to assume it has been removed from the network and therefore dealt with.

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of items not in the inventory
* M2 = Count of items in M1
* M3 = List of items not reachable
* M4 = Count of items in M3
* M5 = List of items not in the inventory or that are unreachable
* M6 = Count of items in M5
* M7 = List of items in the inventory
* M8 = Count of items in M7
* M9 = The number of items from Input 1 **NOT** passing either Operation 1 or Operation 2
* M10 = The total number of items in Input 1

Metrics
-------

Unauthorized Asset Remediation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

	* - **Metric**
	  - | The ratio of unaccounted for, unauthorized assets, to the total assets in the asset inventory. If the value of M6 is 0, there are no unauthorized assets that remain unaccounted for. In this case, the value of the metric is 1.
	* - **Calculation**
	  - :code:`(M8 - M6) / M8`
