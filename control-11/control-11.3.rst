* Sub-control 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory
* Sub-control 1.5: Maintain Asset Inventory Information
* Sub-control 2.1: Maintain Inventory of Authorized Software

Inputs
------
#. The organization's configuration monitoring system
#. The list of network devices
#. The inventory and mappings of secure configuration policy(ies) to the list of network devices

Operations
----------
#. For each network devices, obtain the configuration assessment results using Input 1

Measures
--------
* M1(i) = (For each network device "i") Count of non-compliant recommendations resulting from Operation 1
* M2(i) = (For each network device "i") Count of recommendations assessed

Metrics
-------

Non-Compliance Ratio
