Inputs
-----------
#. List of authorized remote hosts

Operations
----------
#. For each host in the list of authorized remote hosts, check the remote access software configuration:
	#. Encrypted connections are required
	#. Multi-factor authentication is required

Measures
--------
* M1 = Count of authorized remote hosts (from Input 1)
* M2 = List of authorized remote hosts with encryption required
* M3 = Count of M2
* M4 = List of authorized remote hosts without encryption required
* M5 = Count of M4
* M6 = List of authorized remote hosts with multi-factor authentication required
* M7 = Count of M6
* M8 = List of authorized remote hosts without multi-factor authentication required
* M9 = Count of M8
* M10 = List of authorized remote hosts with both encryption and multi-factor authentication required
* M11 = Count of M10
* M12 = List of authorized remote hosts without either encryption or multi-factor authentication required
* M13 = Count of M12
