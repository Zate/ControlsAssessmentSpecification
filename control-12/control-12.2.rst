12.2: Scan for Unauthorized Connections Across Trusted Network Boundaries
=========================================================================
Perform regular scans from outside each trusted network boundary to detect any unauthorized connections which are accessible across the boundary.

Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory
* Sub-control 1.5: Maintain Asset Inventory Information
* Sub-control 12.1: Maintain an Inventory of Network Boundaries

Inputs
-----------
#. Inventory of Network Boundaries
#. List of most recent scan times for each network boundary
#. Maximum allowable time frame between scans

Operations
----------
#. For each network boundary in Input 1, compare the corresponding time of most recent scan from Input 2 to the maximum allowable time provided in Input 3.
#. Create a list of network boundaries whose most recent scan time was within the allowable time frame (M1).
#. Create a list of network boundaries whose most recent scan time was outside the allowable time frame (M2).

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of network boundaries whose most recent scan time was within the allowable time frame (compliant list)
* M2 = List of network boundaries whose most recent scan time was outside the allowable time frame (non-compliant list)
* M3 = Count of network boundaries that were scanned recently enough (count of M1)
* M4 = Total count of network boundaries (count of Input 1)
