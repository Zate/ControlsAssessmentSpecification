Inputs
-----------
#. The list of endpoints
#. The list of trusted and necessary IP address ranges
#. The list of known malicious IP addresses
#. The list of unused Internet IP addresses

Operations
----------
#. Enumerate all network devices identified as guarding a network boundary
#. For each network boundary device, examine its configuration to ensure rules as follows, noting appropriately and inappropriately configured devices:
	#. Allow communications only with IP addresses in the list of trusted and necessary IP address ranges
	#. Explicitly deny communications with IP addresses in the list of known malicious IP addresses
	#. Explicitly deny communications with IP addresses in the list of unused IP addresses

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of all network boundary devices
* M2 = List of appropriately configured network boundary devices
* M3 = List of inappropriately configured network boundary devices
* M4 = Count of network boundary devices (the count of M1)
* M5 = Count of appropriately configured network boundary devices (the count of M2)
* M6 = Count of inappropriately configured network boundary devices (the count of M3)
