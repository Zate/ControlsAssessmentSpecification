12.9: Deploy Application Layer Filtering Proxy Server
=========================================================
Ensure that all network traffic to or from the Internet passes through an authenticated application layer proxy that is configured to filter unauthorized connections.

Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory
* Sub-control 1.5: Maintain Asset Inventory Information
* Sub-control 2.1: Maintain Inventory of Authorized Software
* Sub-control 2.5: Integrate Software and Hardware Asset Inventories

Inputs
-----------
#. The list of endpoints
#. The list of authorized software
#. The list of unauthorized connections

Operations
----------
#. Enumerate network devices guarding Internet network boundaries
#. Enumerate application-layer proxies
#. For each application-layer proxy
	#. Enumerate the network boundary devices it covers
	#. For each Internet network boundary device it covers
		#. Ensure it is appropriately configured to filter against the list of unauthorized connections
#. Enumerate the set of covered Internet network boundary devices

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of Internet network boundary devices
* M2 = List of application-layer proxies
* M3 = List of appropriately configured application-layer proxies
* M4 = List of inappropriately configured application-layer proxies
* M5 = List of covered Internet network boundary devices
* M6 = Count of Internet network boundary devices (count of M1)
* M7 = Count of application-layer proxies (count of M2)
* M8 = Count of appropriately configured application-layer proxies (count of M3)
* M9 = Count of inappropriately configured application-layer proxies (count of M4)
* M10 = Count of covered Internet network boundary devices (count of M5)

Metrics
