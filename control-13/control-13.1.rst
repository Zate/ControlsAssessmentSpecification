13.1: Maintain an Inventory of Sensitive Information
=========================================================
Maintain an inventory of all sensitive information stored, processed, or transmitted by the organizationâ€™s technology systems, including those located on-site or at a remote service provider.

Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory

Inputs
-----------
#. Classification Scheme: The organizationally-defined classification scheme
#. The data set of sensitive information for which the organization is responsible, mapped to the classification scheme defined by Input 1
#. A mapping of an organization's endpoints/systems containing sensitive information classified by Input 2 (ideally using the endpoint inventory; see sub-control 1.4)

Operations
----------
#. Create the mappings of information deemed "sensitive" to the organization to the organization's classification scheme.
#. Create the mappings of classified, sensitive information to the endpoints/systems on which that information is stored

Measures
--------
* M1 = 1 if the mappings of "sensitive" information to the organization's classification scheme is provided; 0 otherwise
* M2 = 1 if the mappings of classified, sensitive information to the endpoints/systems on which it resides is provided; 0 otherwise

Metrics
