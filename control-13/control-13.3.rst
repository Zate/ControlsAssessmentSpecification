Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 2.1: Maintain Inventory of Authorized Software
* Sub-control 12.1: Maintain an Inventory of Network Boundaries

Inputs
-----------
#. The list of authorized software
#. The list of network perimeters

Operations
----------
#. Enumerate all network perimeter monitoring systems
#. For each network perimeter monitoring system:
	#. Enumerate the network perimeters covered by the system
	#. Examine its configuration to ensure that the system is configured to:
		#. Monitor for sensitive information
		#. Block transfer of detected sensitive information
		#. Alert appropriately
#. Enumerate network perimeters covered by all network perimeter monitoring systems
#. Complement the set of covered network perimeters with the list of network perimeters to identify all uncovered network perimeters

Assumptions
^^^^^^^^^^^
* Network perimeter monitoring systems are primarily software-based


Measures
--------
* M1 = List of network perimeter monitoring systems
* M2 = List of network perimeters
* M3 = List of appropriately configured perimeter monitoring systems
* M4 = List of inappropriately configured perimeter monitoring systems
* M5 = List of network perimeters covered by at least one network perimeter monitoring system
* M6 = List of network perimeters not covered by at least one network perimeter monitoring system
* M7 = Count of network perimeter monitoring systems (count of M1)
* M8 = Count of network perimeters (count of M2)
* M9 = Count of appropriately configured perimeter monitoring systems (count of M3)
* M10 = Count of inappropriately configured perimeter monitoring systems (count of M4)
* M11 = Count of network perimeters covered by at least one network perimeter monitoring system (count of M5)
* M12 = Count of network perimeters not covered by at least one network perimeter monitoring system (count of M6)
