13.7: Manage USB Devices
=========================================================
If USB storage devices are required, enterprise software should be used that can configure systems to allow the use of specific devices.  An inventory of such devices should be maintained.

Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory
* Sub-control 1.5: Maintain Asset Inventory Information
* Sub-control 2.1: Maintain Inventory of Authorized Software
* Sub-control 2.5: Integrate Software and Hardware Asset Inventories

Inputs
-----------
#. The list of endpoints
#. The list of authorized USB storage devices
#. Enterprise software which can configure systems to allow the use of specific devices

Operations
----------
#. For each endpoint "i", determine if the software specified by Input 3 is installed (M2(i))
#. For each endpoint "i", collect the whitelist of USB devices allowed for use (M3(i))
#. For each endpoint's whitelist, calculate the intersection with the authorized USB device inventory from Input 2. The "right-side" of the calculation indicates USB devices on the endpoint's whitelist which are not contained in the authorized USB device inventory.

Measures
--------
* M1 = Count of endpoints
* M2(i) = (For each endpoint "i") 1 if Operation 1 indicates the appropriate software is installed on device "i"; 0 otherwise
* M3 = (For each endpoint) The number of USB devices allowed
* M4 = (For each endpoint) The number of USB devices contained in the whitelist which are not in the authorized USB device inventory
* M5(i) = (For each endpoint "i") 1 if M4 > 0 for device "i"; 0 otherwise

Metrics
-------

Whitelisting Software Coverage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

	* - **Metric**
	  - | The ratio of endpoints with whitelisting software installed to the total number of endpoints.
	* - **Calculation**
	  - :code:`(SUM from i=1..M1 (M2(i))) / M1`

Non-Inventoried but Whitelisted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

	* - **Metric**
	  - | The ratio of endpoints with non-inventories but whitelisted USB device allowance to the total number of endpoints.
	* - **Calculation**
	  - :code:`(SUM from i=1..M1 (M5(i))) / M1`

Full Coverage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

	* - **Metric**
	  - | The ratio of endpoints with inventoried USB storage device capability and USB whitelisting software installed to the total number of endpoints.
	* - **Calculation**
	  - :code:`(SUM from i=1..M1 (M2(i) * M5(i))) / M1`
