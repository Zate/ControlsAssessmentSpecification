14.7: Enforce Access Control to Data Through Automated Tools
=========================================================
Use an automated tool, such as host-based Data Loss Prevention, to enforce access controls to data even when the data is copied off a system.

Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory
* Sub-control 1.5: Maintain Asset Inventory Information
* Sub-control 2.1: Maintain Inventory of Authorized Software
* Sub-control 2.5: Integrate Software and Hardware Asset Inventories

Inputs
-----------
#. The list of endpoints
#. The list of authorized software

Operations
----------
#. Enumerate endpoints capable of storing data
#. Enumerate all DLP software
#. For each instance of DLP software:
	#. Enumerate the endpoints covered by the DLP software
#. Enumerate all endpoints covered by the set of DLP software
#. Complement the list of covered endpoints with the list of endpoints enumerated in the first operation to get the enumeration of endpoints not covered

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of endpoints capable of storing data
* M2 = List of DLP software instances
* M3 = List of all endpoints covered by the set of DLP software
* M4 = List of all endpoints not covered by the set of DLP software
* M5 = Count of endpoints capable of storing data (count of M1)
* M6 = Count of DLP software instances (count of M2)
* M7 = Count of endpoints covered by the set of DLP software (count of M3)
* M8 = Count of endpoints not covered by the set of DLP software (count of M4)

Metrics
