Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 2.1: Maintain Inventory of Authorized Software

Inputs
-----------
#. The list of network vulnerability scanning tools
#. Approved configuration(s) for detecting unauthorized wireless access points (WAPs)
#. Approved configuration(s) for alerting on unauthorized wireless access points (WAPs)

Operations
----------
#. For each network vulnerability scanning tool in Input 1, check its configuration against the appropriate approved detection configuration in Input 2.
#. Make a list of those network vulnerability scanning tools that are configured correctly for detecting unauthorized WAPs (M1)
#. Make a list of those that are not configured correctly (M2) noting the deviations.
#. For each network vulnerability scanning tool in Input 1, check its configuration against the appropriate approved alerting configuration in Input 3.
#. Make a list of those network vulnerability scanning tools that are configured correctly for alerting on unauthorized WAPs (M3)
#. Make a list of those that are not configured correctly (M4) noting the deviations.

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of network vulnerability scanning tools correctly configured for detecting unauthorized WAPs
* M2 = List of network vulnerability scanning tools not correctly configured for detecting unauthorized WAPs
* M3 = List of network vulnerability scanning tools correctly configured for alerting on unauthorized WAPs
* M4 = List of network vulnerability scanning tools not correctly configured for alerting on unauthorized WAPs
* M5 = Count of network vulnerability scanning tools correctly configured for detecting unauthorized WAPs (count of M1)
* M6 = Count of network vulnerability scanning tools correctly configured for alerting on unauthorized WAPs (count of M3)
* M7 = Total count of network vulnerability scanning tools (count of Input 1)
* M8 = List of network vulnerability scanning tools correctly configured for both detecting and alerting on unauthorized WAPs (intersection of M1 and M3)
* M9 = Count of network vulnerability scanning tools correctly configured for both detecting and alerting on unauthorized WAPs (count of M8)
