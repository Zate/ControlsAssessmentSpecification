Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory
* Sub-control 1.5: Maintain Asset Inventory Information

Inputs
-----------
#. The list of endpoints

Operations
----------
#. Enumerate all wireless-access-capable endpoints
#. For each identified endpoint:
	#. Determine whether the device has an identified business purpose for wireless access
	#. Examine the endpoint's configuration to determine whether wireless access is enabled
#. Enumerate all endpoints with wireless access enabled and without an identified business purpose for wireless access
#. Enumerate all endpoints without wireless access enabled and without an identified business purpose for wireless access
#. Enumerate all endpoints with wireless access enabled and with an identified business purpose for wireless access

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of all wireless-access-capable endpoints
* M2 = List of endpoints with wireless access enabled and without an identified business purpose for wireless access
* M3 = List of endpoints without wireless access enabled and without an identified business purpose
* M4 = List of endpoints with wireless access enabled and with an identified business purpose for wireless access
* M5 = Count of wireless-access-capable endpoints (count of M1)
* M6 = Count of endpoints with wireless access enabled and without an identified business purpose for wireless access (count of M2)
* M7 = Count of endpoints without wireless access enabled and without an identified business purpose (count of M3)
* M8 = Count of endpoints with wireless access enabled and with an identified business purpose for wireless access (count of M4)
* M9 = M7 + M8
