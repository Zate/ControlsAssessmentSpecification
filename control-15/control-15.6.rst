Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory
* Sub-control 1.5: Maintain Asset Inventory Information

Inputs
-----------
#. The list of wireless clients (subset of hardware inventory)
#. Approved configurations to disable peer-to-peer (adhoc) wireless network capabilities

Operations
----------
#. For each wireless client in Input 1, compare its configuration against the appropriate approved configuration(s) from Input 2.
#. Make a list of wireless clients that adhere to the approved configurations (M1)
#. Make a list of wireless clients that do not (M2), noting the deviations from the approved configurations.

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of wireless clients properly configured to disable peer-to-peer (adhoc) wireless network capabilities (compliant list)
* M2 = List of wireless clients not properly configured to disable peer-to-peer (adhoc) wireless network capabilities (non-compliant list)
* M3 = Count of wireless clients with peer-to peer (adhoc) wireless network capabilities disabled (count of M1)
* M4 = Total count of wireless clients (count of Input 1)
