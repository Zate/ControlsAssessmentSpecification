Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory
* Sub-control 1.5: Maintain Asset Inventory Information

Inputs
-----------
#. List of wireless devices (derived from Endpoint Inventory; sub-control 1.4)
#. List of AES-capable wireless devices (sub-control 1.5)

Operations
----------
#. For each AES-capable wireless device, collect cipher suite configuration

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of wireless devices
* M2 = Count of wireless devices
* M3 = List of AES-capable wireless devices
* M4 = Count of AES-capable wireless devices
* M5 = List of non-AES-capable wireless devices
* M6 = Count of non-AES-capable wireless devices
* M7 = List of appropriately configured AES-capable wireless devices
* M8 = Count of appropriately configured AES-capable wireless devices
* M9 = List of inappropriately configured AES-capable wireless devices
* M10 = Count of inappropriately configured AES-capable wireless devices
