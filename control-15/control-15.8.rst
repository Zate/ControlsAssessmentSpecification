15.8: Use Wireless Authentication Protocols That Require Mutual, Multi-Factor Authentication
============================================================================================
Ensure that wireless networks use authentication protocols such as Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP/TLS), that requires mutual, multi-factor authentication.

Inputs
-----------
#. The list of endpoints
#. The list of authorized authentication protocols

Operations
----------
#. Enumerate all wireless access points
#. For each identified wireless access point, examine its configuration for the following noting appropriately and inappropriately configured endpoints along the way:
	#. Configured authentication protocol (compare to list of authorized authentication protocols)
#. Enumerate all appropriately configured endpoints
#. Enumerate all inappropriately configured endpoints

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of all wireless access points
* M2 = List of appropriately configured wireless access points
* M3 = List of inappropriately configured wireless access points
* M4 = Count of wireless access points (count of M1)
* M5 = Count of appropriately configured wireless access points (count of M2)
* M6 = Count of inappropriately configured wireless access points (count of M3)
