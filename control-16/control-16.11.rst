Inputs
-----------
#. List of workstations which have enabled automatic workstation locking
#. List of workstations
#. The workstation configuration policy establishing the organization's workstation locking time threshold

Operations
----------

* M4 = Count of M3
* M5 = List of appropriately configured workstations
* M6 = Count of M5
* M7 = List of inappropriately configured workstations
* M8 = Count of M7
