Inputs
-----------
#. Account inventory organized by authentication system (from Sub-Control 16.6)
#. Approved configuration(s) to require multi-factor authentication (MFA).  This will likely be a configuration for each type of authentication system in use

Operations
----------
#. For each account in the account inventory (Input 1), check to see if that account is configured to require MFA in accordance with the appropriate approved configuration(s) from Input 2.  
#. Create a list of accounts that are properly configured to require MFA (M1)
#. Create a list of accounts that are not properly configured to require MFA (M2) noting the deviations from the approved configuration.

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of accounts that are properly configured to require MFA (compliant list)
* M2 = List of accounts that are not properly configured to require MFA (non-compliant list)
* M3 = Count of accounts properly configured to require MFA (count of M1)
* M4 = Total number of accounts (count of Input 1)
