* Sub-control 16.1: Inventory of Authentication Systems

Inputs
-----------
#. Authentication System Inventory
#. The organization's current account inventory (the "to be checked" inventory)

Operations
----------
#. For each authentication system in Input 1, enumerate the accounts under that authentication system.  This ground truth list of accounts organized by authentication system becomes M1.
#. Compare the accounts listed in M1 to the accounts listed in the current account inventory (Input 2).
#. Create a list of the correct accounts in Input 2 (which will be M2)
#. Create a list of the incorrect accounts in Input 2 (which will be M3).

Measures
--------
* M1 = Ground truth account inventory
* M2 = List of correct accounts from the current (to be checked) inventory
* M3 = List of incorrect accounts from the current (to be checked) inventory
* M4 = Count of accounts in the ground truth account inventory (count of M1)
* M5 = Count of correct accounts in the current (to be checked) account inventory (count of M2)
