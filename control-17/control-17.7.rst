#. List of workforce members
#. List of most recent security awareness training completion dates for each workforce member
#. Required frequency of training (at least annually)

Operations

#. For each workforce member in Input 1, check Input 2 to see if that workforce member's most recent security awareness training completion date was within the time frame specified by Input 3 (if the workforce member is not listed in Input 2, assume the workforce member is not compliant). Generate a list of compliant workforce members (M1) and a list of non-compliant workforce members (M2).

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of workforce members who have completed the security awareness training within the specified time frame (compliant list)
* M2 = List of workforce members who have not completed the security awareness training within the specified time frame (non-compliant list)
* M3 = Number of workforce members in the compliant list (M1)
* M4 = Number of workforce members in the non-compliant list (M2)
* M5 = Total number of workforce members in Input 1
