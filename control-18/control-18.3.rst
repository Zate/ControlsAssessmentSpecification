Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 2.1: Maintain Inventory of Authorized Software
* Sub-control 2.2: Ensure Software is Supported by Vendor
* Sub-control 5.1: Establish Secure Configurations

Inputs
-----------
#. List of software acquired from outside the organization, including version information for each (subset of Authorized Software List from Sub-Control 2.1). As described in Sub-Control 2.2, this list should also include the supported or unsupported status for each.
#. The list of organizational security configuration standards from Sub-Control 5.1

Operations
----------
#. For each software version listed in Input 1, check the list of organizational security configuration standards provided in Input 2.
	#. Create a list of software versions that have at least one associated organizational security configuration standard (M1) including identifiers for the associated standard(s)
	#. Create a list of software versions that do not have any associated organizational security configuration standards (M2)
#. For each software version listed in M2, check the supported/unsupported status field for that software version in Input 1 to see if that product version is still supported by the developer.
	#. Create a list of software versions that appear in M2 and are not supported (M3).

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of externally acquired software that has an associated organizational security configuration standard
* M2 = List of externally acquired software that does not have an associated organizational security configuration standard
* M3 = List of externally acquired software that does not have an associated organizational security configuration standard and is also not supported by the developer (non-compliant list)
* M4 = Count of externally acquired software that does not have an associated organizational security configuration standard and is also not supported by the developer (count of M3)
* M5 = Total count of externally acquired software (count of Input 1)
