Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 2.1: Maintain Inventory of Authorized Software

Inputs
-----------
#. The list of authorized software
#. Third-party component inventory (possibly from your automated build systems)

Operations
----------
#. Enumerate all third-party components in the inventory
#. For each component, verify:
	#. Latest component is being used
	#. The component is explicitly trusted by the organization
#. Enumerate compliant components
#. Enumerate non-compliant components

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of all third-party components being used
* M2 = List of all third-party components that are up-to-date and explicitly trusted
* M3 = List of all third-party components that are not up-to-date or not explicitly trusted
* M4 = Count of third-party components being used (count of M1)
* M5 = Count of third-party components that are up-to-date and explicitly trusted (count of M2)
* M6 = Count of third-party components that are not up-to-date or not explicitly trusted (count of M3)

Metrics
