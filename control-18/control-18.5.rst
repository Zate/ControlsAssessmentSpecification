Inputs
-----------
#. List of encryption algorithms used by the organization
#. Authoritative source that identifies which encryption algorithms are standardized, currently accepted, and extensively reviewed.

Operations
----------
#. For each encryption algorithm in Input 1, check Input 2 to see if that encryption algorithm is standardized, currently accepted, and extensively reviewed.
	#. Create a list of the encryption algorithms that meet all of these criteria (M1)
	#. Create a list of the encryption algorithms that do not meet all of these criteria (M2).

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of encryption algorithms used by the organization that are standardized, currently accepted, and extensively reviewed (compliant list)
* M2 = List of encryption algorithms used by the organization that do not meet these criteria (non-compliant list)
* M3 = Count of encryption algorithms used by the organization that are standardized, currently accepted, and extensively reviewed (count of M1)
* M4 = Total count of encryption algorithms used by the organization (count of Input 1)
