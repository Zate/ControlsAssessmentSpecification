Inputs
-----------
#. Written process for accepting and addressing software vulnerabilities

Operations
----------
#. Determine whether a written process for accepting and addressing software vulnerabilities exists (M1).
#. Manually review the written process for accepting and addressing software vulnerabilities (Input 1).
	#. Identify whether the document provides a means for external entities to contact your security group (M2)
	#. Identify whether the document adequately describes the process for accepting reports of software vulnerabilities (M3)
	#. Identify whether the document adequately describes the process for addressing those reports (M4)

Measures
--------
* M1 = Boolean value indicating whether a written process for accepting and addressing software vulnerabilities exists; 1 if it exists, 0 if it does not
* M2 = Boolean value indicating whether the document provides a means for external entities to contact your security group; 1 if the document provides this info, 0 if it does not
* M3 = Boolean value indicating whether the document adequately describes the process for accepting reports of software vulnerabilities; 1 if the document adequately describes this process, 0 if it does not
* M4 = Boolean value indicating whether the document adequately describes the process for addressing reports of software vulnerabilities; 1 if the document adequately describes this process, 0 if it does not
