Dependencies

* Sub-control 19.1: Document Incident Response Procedures

Inputs
-----------
#. Incident Reporting Standards document

Operations
----------
#. Determine whether the Incident Reporting Standards document exists. If the document exists, set M1 equal to 1. If it does not exist, set M1 equal to 0 and skip the remaining operations.
#. Manually review the Incident Reporting Standards document to determine if it addresses:
	#. The time required for system administrators and other workforce members to report anomalous events to the incident handling team (M2)
	#. The mechanisms for such reporting (M3)
	#. The kind of information that should be included in the incident notification (M4)
#. For each, set the measure to 1 if the document adequately addresses the topic, or 0 if the document fails to adequately address the topic.

Measures
--------
* M1 = Boolean value indicating if the Incident Reporting Standards document exists; 1 if it exists, 0 if not
* M2 = Boolean value indicating if the Incident Reporting Standards document adequately addresses the time required for system administrators and other workforce members to report anomalous events to the incident handling team; 1 if it does, 0 if it does not
* M3 = Boolean value indicating if the Incident Reporting Standards document adequately addresses the mechanisms for reporting anomalous events to the incident handling team; 1 if it does, 0 if it does not
* M4 = Boolean value indicating if the Incident Reporting Standards document adequately addresses the kind of information that should be included in an incident notification to the incident handling team; 1 if it does, 0 if it does not
