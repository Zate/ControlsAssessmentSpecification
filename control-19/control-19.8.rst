Inputs
-----------
#. Enterprise incident management policy

Operations
----------
#. Examine the enterprise incident management policy for the following properties:
	#. Incident scoring and prioritization schema based on known or potential impact
	#. Procedure relying on this schema is used to determine status update frequency during incident handling
	#. Procedure relying on this schema is used to determine escalation paths during incident handling

Measures
--------
* M1 = (Boolean) 1 if an incident scoring and prioritization schema is present in the policy; 0 otherwise
* M2 = (Boolean) 1 if status update procedure relies on aforementioned schema; 0 otherwise
* M3 = (Boolean) 1 if escalation procedure relies on aforementioned schema; 0 otherwise
