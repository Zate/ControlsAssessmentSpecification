2.2: Ensure Software is Supported by Vendor
===========================================
Ensure that only software applications or operating systems currently supported and receiving vendor updates are added to the organizationâ€™s authorized software inventory.  Unsupported software should be tagged as unsupported in the inventory system.

Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 2.1: Maintain Inventory of Authorized Software

Inputs
------
#. Authorized Software List: The authorized software list with a notation of "supported" or "unsupported" for each entry (sub-control 2.1)
#. Access to an authoritative source of information indicating supported/unsupported details by product.

Operations
----------
#. For each entry in Input 1, perform a lookup in Input 2 to verify.
#. For each entry in Input 1 labeled "supported", perform a lookup in Input 2.  From these lookups, note the list of authorized software labeled "supported" but are actually not supported based on the authoritative source lookup.
#. For each entry in Input 1 labeled "unsupported", perform a lookup in Input 2.  From these lookups, note the list of authorized software labeled "unsupported" but are actually supported based on the authoritative source lookup.

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of items in the authorized software list that are unsupported (combination of Operation 1 and those initially marked as unsupported in Input 1)
* M2 = Count of M1
* M3 = List of authorized software
* M4 = Count of M3
* M5 = List of items in the authorized software list that are mislabeled as supported
* M6 = Count of M5
* M7 = List of items in the authorized software list that are mislabeled as unsupported
* M8 = Count of M7
* M9 = # of items in Input 1 that are unsupported (combination of Operation 1 results and those initially marked as unsupported in Input 1)
* M10 = Total # of authorized software (from Input 1)
* M11 = The number of items from Input 1 labeled "supported" but are actually not supported (from Operation 2)
* M12 = The number of items from Input 1 labeled "unsupported" but are actually supported (from Operation 3)
