Dependencies

* None

Inputs
-----------
#. A Penetration Testing Program document

Operations
----------
#. Determine whether the Penetration Testing Program document exists. If the document exists, set M1 equal to 1. If it does not exist, set M1 equal to 0 and skip the remaining operations.
#. Manually review the Penetration Testing Program document to determine if it addresses a full scope of blended attacks (including wireless, client-based, and web application). If the document adequately addresses a full scope of attacks, set M2 equal to 1. If it does not, set M2 equal to 0.

Measures
--------
* M1 = Boolean value indicating if the Penetration Testing Program document exists; 1 if it exists, 0 otherwise
* M2 = Boolean value indicating if the Penetration Testing Program document adequately addresses a full scope of attacks; 1 if it does, 0 otherwise
