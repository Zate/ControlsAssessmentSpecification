* Sub-control 20.1: Establish a Penetration Testing Program

Inputs
-----------
#. Penetration Testing Program document

Operations
----------
#. Manually review the Penetration Testing Program document (Input 1) to determine if it requires tests to discover the following unprotected system information:
	#. Network diagrams (M1)
	#. Configuration files (M2)
	#. Penetration test reports (M3)
	#. Emails or documents containing passwords or other information critical to system operation (M4)

Measures
--------
* M1 = Boolean value indicating if the Penetration Testing Program document requires tests to discover unprotected network diagrams; 1 if so, 0 otherwise
* M2 = Boolean value indicating if the Penetration Testing Program document requires tests to discover unprotected configuration files; 1 if so, 0 otherwise
* M3 = Boolean value indicating if the Penetration Testing Program document requires tests to discover unprotected penetration test reports; 1 if so, 0 otherwise
* M4 = Boolean value indicating if the Penetration Testing Program document requires tests to discover unprotected emails or documents containing passwords or other critical system information; 1 if so, 0 otherwise
