20.8: Control and Monitor Accounts Associated With Penetration Testing
======================================================================

Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 16.6: Maintain an Inventory of Accounts
* Sub-control 20.1: Establish a Penetration Testing Program

Inputs
-----------
#. The historical inventory of user and system accounts (prior to input 3)
#. The current inventory of user and system accounts (after input 4)
#. The timestamp for the beginning of the most recent penetration testing period
#. The timestamp for the ending of the most recent penetration testing period

Operations
----------
#. Enumerate historical user and system accounts (Input 1) and note any privileges specifically assigned for penetration testing (M1)
#. Enumerate the current user and system accounts and privileges for those accounts determined in Operation 1

Measures
--------
* M1 = The list of historical user and system accounts authorized for use in penetration testing
* M2 = Count of historical user and system accounts authorized for use in penetration testing (count of M1)
* M3 = The list of current user and system accounts that were authorized for use in penetration testing
* M4 = Count of current user and system accounts that were authorized for use in penetration testing (count of M3)
* M5 = The list of current user and system accounts with penetration testing privileges still assigned
* M6 = Count of current user and system accounts with penetration testing privileges still assigned (count of M5)

Metrics
-------

Privileged Accounts Remain
