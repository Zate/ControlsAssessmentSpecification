* Sub-control 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory

Inputs
------
#. List of vulnerability scanning accounts
#. List of vulnerability scanning machines

Operations
----------
#. For each vulnerability scanning account, ensure account configuration to log in only to one or more of the vulnerability scanning machines

Measures
--------
* M1 = Total number of vulnerability scanning accounts (from Input 1)
* M2 = List of vulnerability scanning accounts configured to log in only to one or more of the vulnerability scanning machines
* M3 = Count of M2
* M4 = List of vulnerability scanning account configured to log in to any machine other than one of the vulnerability scanning machines
* M5 = Count of M4

Metrics
