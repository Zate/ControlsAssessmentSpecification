3.4: Deploy Automated Operating System Patch Management Tools
=============================================================
Deploy automated software update tools in order to ensure that the operating systems are running the most recent security updates provided by the software vendor.

Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 5.1: Establish Secure Configurations

Inputs
------
#. The required OS auto-update configuration (this could vary by organization, by product, by security tool, etc.). It could be 1 setting or multiple settings. It would need to be determined if partial settings are creditable, potential weighting of settings, any dependencies, etc. Such logic should all be part of Input 1.
#. The list of required updates (this could be pulled from the vendor's website, or could be an organization's selected subset of updates). *Optional Field*: If time metrics are desired, this list would also need a date when each update on the list was released by the vendor.
#. The list of endpoints to be checked.
#. *Optional*: If time metrics are desired, the allowable time frame for installation of an update after its release (recommend at least 30 days)

Operations
----------
#. For each endpoint in Input 3, compare that endpoint's auto-update configuration to that provided in Input 1 and generate a score based on the logic provided by Input 1 (M1).
#. For each endpoint in Input 3, retrieve a list of installed OS updates (M2) and compare that endpoint's installed updates to the required updates provided by Input 2.  The list of matching updates is M3.
#. (Optional) If timing metrics are desired, for each endpoint, also determine the elapsed time between the update release date provided in Input 2 and the install date for each of the corresponding updates on the endpoint; this information could be added as another field attached to each update entry in M3.

Measures
--------
* M1 = Endpoint-specific auto-update configuration score as determined in Operation 1.
* M2 = Endpoint-specific list of installed updates as determined in Operation 2.
* M3 = Endpoint-specific list of required updates that are installed, as determined in Operation 2.
* M4 = The number of required OS updates per Input 2.
* M5 = The number of required OS updates that are installed on the endpoint, per M3.

Metrics
-------

Update Effectiveness (Per Endpoint)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

	* - **Metric**
	  - | For a given endpoint, calculate the ratio of installed OS updates to the total number of OS updates required.
	* - **Calculation**
	  - If M4 = 0, this indicates the endpoint requires no OS updates. Otherwise, this metric is calculated as :code:`M5 / M4`

Update Effectiveness (Organizational)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

	* - **Metric**
	  - | The organizational metric is calculated by averaging the results of the "per endpoint" metric above.
	* - **Calculation**
