This machine will not be used for reading email, composing documents, or browsing the Internet.

* Sub-control 1.5: Maintain Asset Inventory Information
* Sub-control 2.1: Maintain Inventory of Authorized Software
* Sub-control 2.5: Integrate Software and Hardware Asset Inventories

Inputs
-----------
#. The list of endpoints
#. The list of authorized software

Operations
----------
#. Enumerate the devices used for administrative purposes based on the endpoint inventory
#. Enumerate all software identified as administrative from the software inventory
#. For each identified device:
	#. Enumerate the devices configured/managed by this device
	#. Examine its configuration noting whether it is appropriately or inappropriately configured:
		#. The device has internet access
		#. The device can run unauthorized software
		#. The device can be reached by any device not in the enumeration identified above

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of devices used for administrative purposes
* M2 = List of administrative software
* M3 = List of appropriately configured devices
* M4 = List of inappropriately configured devices
* M5 = Count of devices used for administrative purposes (count of M1)
* M6 = Count of administrative software (count of M2)
* M7 = Count of appropriately configured devices (count of M3)
* M8 = Count of inappropriately configured devices (count of M4)
