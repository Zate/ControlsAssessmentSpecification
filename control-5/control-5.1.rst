Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 2.1: Maintain Inventory of Authorized Software

Inputs
------
#. Authorized Software List: The list of authorized software (sub-control 2.1).
#. Security Configuration Standards: The list of enterprise security configuration standards.

Assumptions
^^^^^^^^^^^
* Documentation of secure configuration standards should include any approved deviations/exceptions from industry-standard security baselines such as CIS benchmarks, DISA Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs), or U.S. government configuration baselines (USGCB).

Operations
----------
#. Perform a set calculation, computing the Intersection (M1) of Input 1 and Input 2

Measures
--------
* M1 = The list of authorized software with associated enterprise security configuration standards
* M2 = Count of M1
* M3 = The list of authorized software without enterprise security configuration standards (the "left" side of the set calculation)
* M4 = Count of M3
* M5 = The list of enterprise security configuration standards without associated authorized software (the "right" side of the set calculation)
* M6 = Count of M5
* M7 = The list of authorized software
* M8 = Count of M7

Metrics
