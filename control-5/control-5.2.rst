5.2: Maintain Secure Images
=========================================================
Maintain secure images or templates for all systems in the enterprise based on the organizationâ€™s approved configuration standards.  Any new system deployment or existing system that becomes compromised should be imaged using one of those images or templates.

	  - Protect
	  - 2, 3

Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory
* Sub-control 2.1: Maintain Inventory of Authorized Software
* Sub-control 5.1: Establish Secure Configurations

Inputs
------
#. The list of the organization's approved configuration standards, per implementation of sub-control 5.1
#. The inventory of systems
#. The mapping of systems in the inventory to any secure configurations that should be applied. This input assumes that multiple configurations could apply to a single system in the inventory.
#. The inventory of images

Operations
----------
#. For each system in the inventory, determine the list of systems which have had an image taken and the list of systems without a corresponding image.
#. For each system with a corresponding image, compare the image's configuration with the configuration standard(s) mapped to that system.

Measures
--------
* M1 = Count of systems in the inventory (from Input 2)
* M2 = Count of systems with a corresponding image taken
* M3 = 1 if an image is configured according to the standards mapped to that system; 0 otherwise.
* M4 = List of systems with a corresponding image taken
* M5 = List of systems without a corresponding image taken

Metrics
-------

Image Coverage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

	* - **Metric**
	  - | The ratio of systems with a corresponding image taken to the total number of inventoried systems
	* - **Calculation**
	  - :code:`M2 / M1`

Configuration Coverage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

	* - **Metric**
	  - | The ratio of all systems with a corresponding image taken to those configured according to the standards mapped to that system
	* - **Calculation**
	  - :code:`(SUM from 1..M2 (M3)) / M2`
