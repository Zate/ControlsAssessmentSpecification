Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory
* Sub-control 5.1: Establish Secure Configurations

Inputs
------
#. Endpoint Inventory: The list of endpoints from the endpoint inventory
#. The list of events that should be logged (an event logging policy).

Assumptions
^^^^^^^^^^^
The assumption is that there could potentially be numerous events which should be logged, and that a checklist verifying the logging policy can be examined per endpoint.

Operations
----------
#. For each endpoint, determine if the configured event logging policy matches the policy defined by Input 2, noting appropriately and inappropriately configured endpoints.

Measures
--------
* M1 = The list of endpoints
* M2 = Count of M1
* M3 = The list of appropriately configured endpoints
* M4 = Count of M3
* M5 = The list of inappropriately configured endpoints
* M6 = Count of M5

Metrics
-------

Logging Policy Coverage
