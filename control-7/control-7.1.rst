Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 2.1: Maintain Inventory of Authorized Software

Inputs
------
#. From the authorized software list (ASL: sub-control 2.1), the inventory of web browser and email client software with a notation of "supported" or "unsupported" for each entry.
#. Access to an authoritative source of information indicating supported/unsupported details by product.

Operations
----------
#. For each entry in Input 1, perform a lookup in Input 2 to verify.
#. For each entry in Input 1 labeled "supported", perform a lookup in Input 2.  From these lookups, note the list of authorized software labeled "supported" but are actually not supported based on the authoritative source lookup.
#. For each entry in Input 1 labeled "unsupported", perform a lookup in Input 2.  From these lookups, note the list of authorized software labeled "unsupported" but are actually supported based on the authoritative source lookup.

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of unsupported items in Input 1 (combination of Operation 1 results and those initially marked as unsupported in input 1)
* M2 = Count of M1
* M3 = List of authorized web browser/email client software
* M4 = Count of M3
* M5 = List of items from Input 1 labeled as "supported" that are not actually supported
* M6 = Count of M5
* M7 = List of items from Input 1 labeled as "unsupported" but are actually supported
* M8 = Count of M7

Metrics

Percentage Unsupported Client Software in Use
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

	* - **Metric**
	  - | The calculation of this metric is determined by the ratio of unsupported web browser/email client software to the total authorized web browser/email client software in use.

Rate of False Positives
