* Sub-control 2.1: Maintain Inventory of Authorized Software

Inputs
------
#. The list of authorized software

Operations
----------
#. Enumerate all e-mail servers in the enterprise
#. For each identified e-mail server, examine its configuration to ensure that either native attachment sandboxing is configured or that an external system is configured to be used for that purpose, noting appropriately and inappropriately configured servers

Assumptions
^^^^^^^^^^^
* The majority of e-mail servers have appropriate configuration attributes to examine.

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of all e-mail servers in the enterprise
* M2 = List of appropriately configured e-mail servers
* M3 = List of inappropriately configured e-mail servers
* M4 = Count of all e-mail servers in the enterprise (count of M1)
* M5 = Count of appropriately configured e-mail servers (count of M2)
* M6 = Count of inappropriately configured e-mail servers (count of M3)
