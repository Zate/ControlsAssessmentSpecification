Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 1.5: Maintain Asset Inventory Information

Inputs
------
#. Endpoint Inventory: The list of endpoints to be audited (sub-control 1.5).
#. The list of accepted DNS filtering services, such as Quad-9.

Operations
----------
#. For each endpoint in Input 1, collect it's DNS configuration setting noting appropriately and inappropriately configured endpoints.

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of audited endpoints
* M2 = Count of M1
* M3 = List of appropriately configured endpoints
* M4 = Count of M3
* M5 = List of inappropriately configured endpoints
* M6 = Count of M5
* M7 = List of systems not using approve DNS servers
* M8 = Count of M7

Metrics

DNS Filtering Coverage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

	* - **Metric**
	  - | Determine the ratio of endpoints configured to use accepted DNS filtering services to the total number of endpoints which utilize DNS.
	* - **Calculation**
	  - :code:`M4 / M2`

Traffic Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

	* - **Metric**
	  - | Utilize traffic analysis to determine if any traffic is *not* being sent through the prescribed DNS services.
	* - **Calculation**
	  - :code:`M8 / M2`
