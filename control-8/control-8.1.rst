=========================================================
Utilize centrally managed anti-malware software to continuously monitor and defend each of the organizationâ€™s workstations and servers.

Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory
* Sub-control 1.5: Maintain Asset Inventory Information
* Sub-control 2.1: Maintain Inventory of Authorized Software

Assumption(s)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* It is assumed that this sub-control is specific to host-based anti-malware solutions.

Inputs
------
#. List of deployed anti-malware software
#. The list of endpoints

Operations
----------
#. For each deployed anti-malware solution, verify that it is centrally managed
#. For each deployed anti-malware solution, enumerate the set of endpoints covered
#. Union the set of covered endpoints
#. Identify set of endpoints eligible for anti-malware coverage (i.e. network devices likely do not run anti-malware agents)

Measures
--------
* M1 = Count of anti-malware solutions in use
* M2 = Count of anti-malware solutions that are centrally managed
* M3 = Total number of endpoints covered by anti-malware solutions
* M4 = Total number of endpoints eligible for anti-malware coverage
* M5 = List of anti-malware solutions that are centrally managed
* M6 = List of anti-malware solutions that are not centrally managed
* M7 = List of endpoints covered by anti-malware solutions
* M8 = List of endpoints not covered by anti-malware solutions 

Metrics
