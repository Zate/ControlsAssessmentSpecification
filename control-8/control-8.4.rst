8.4: Configure Anti-Malware Scanning of Removable Media
=========================================================
Configure devices so that they automatically conduct an anti-malware scan of removable media when inserted or connected.

Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory
* Sub-control 5.1: Establish Secure Configurations

Inputs
-----------
#. Endpoint Inventory: Endpoint inventory (with entry for each endpoint indicating whether that endpoint can support anti-malware software or not)
#. Desired anti-malware configuration (to automatically scan removable media when inserted/connected)

Assumptions
-----------
Some endpoints, such as network devices, may not support anti-malware software. Whether an endpoint supports anti-malware software is provided as part of Input 1. Devices that cannot support anti-malware software are removed from the list of endpoints to be checked during Operation 1, and these devices are not counted in the metric below.

Operations
----------
#. Refine the endpoint inventory (Input 1) to only contain endpoints that can support anti-malware software endpoint inventory - this reduced list of endpoints becomes M1
#. Of the set of endpoints that can support anti-malware software (M1), generate a list of those endpoints that actually have anti-malware software installed, enabled, and adhere to the configuration specified in Input 2 (M2) and a list of the endpoints that do not adhere to the specified configuration (M3). Note: Endpoints in M1 that do not have anti-malware installed and enabled, are considered non-compliant and added to M3.

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of endpoints capable of supporting anti-malware software
* M2 = List of endpoints with anti-malware software installed, enabled, and properly configured to scan removable media (compliant list)
* M3 = List of endpoints not adhering to the specified configuration (non-compliant list)
* M4 = Count of endpoints in M1 (number of endpoints capable of supporting anti-malware software)
* M5 = Count of endpoints in M2 (number of compliant endpoints)
* M6 = Count of endpoints in M3 (number of non-compliant endpoints)

Metrics
