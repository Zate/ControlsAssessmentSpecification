Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 2.1: Maintain Inventory of Authorized Software
* Sub-control 5.1: Establish Secure Configurations

Inputs
------
#. List of software instances (anti-malware software, anti-malware administration tools, and event log servers) that need to be configured to properly send, receive, and log these malware detection events.
#. Approved configuration(s) for anti-malware software, anti-malware administration tools, and event log servers to ensure that malware detection events are properly sent, received, and logged.
#. The total number of malware detection events (M5)
#. The number of alerts being correlated in a central service (M6)

Operations
----------
#. For each software instance in Input 1, check to see if it is configured according to the appropriate approved configuration(s) in Input 2.
#. Create a list of the software instances that are properly configured (M1)
#. Create a list of the software instances that are not properly configured (M2) noting where the deviations occur.

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of software instances that are properly configured for the sending/receiving of malware detection events (compliant list)
* M2 = List of software instances that are not properly configured for the sending/receiving of malware detection events (non-compliant list)
* M3 = Count of properly configured software instances (count of M1)
* M4 = Total count of software instances that need to be configured to properly send/receive malware detection events (count of Input 1)
* M5 = Count of malware detection events
* M6 = Count of alerts being correlated in a central service
