Dependencies
------------
* Sub-control 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory
* Sub-control 1.5: Maintain Asset Inventory Information
* Sub-control 2.1: Maintain Inventory of Authorized Software
* Sub-control 2.5: Integrate Software and Hardware Asset Inventories

Inputs
-----------
#. The list of endpoints
#. The list of authorized software

Operations
----------
#. Enumerate endpoints identified as critical in the endpoint inventory
#. Enumerate all application firewalls from the software inventory
#. For each identified application firewall, enumerate the endpoints it covers
	#. Enumerate the set of identified endpoints - covered endpoints
#. Complement the set of covered endpoints with the set of critical endpoints

Measures
--------
* M1 = List of critical endpoints
* M2 = List of application firewalls
* M3 = List of endpoints covered by at least one application firewall
* M4 = List of endpoints not covered by at least one application firewall
* M5 = Count of critical endpoints (count of M1)
* M6 = Count of application firewalls (count of M2)
* M7 = Count of endpoints covered by at least one application firewall (count of M3)
* M8 = Count of endpoints not covered by at least one application firewall (count of M4)
